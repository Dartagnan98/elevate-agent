# Approvals

Before any external, irreversible, or high-stakes action — stop and create an approval. The user decides. You execute only after they approve.

---

## When to Use

| Action type | Requires approval? |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Sending emails to real people | YES |
| Deploying code to production | YES |
| Posting on social media | YES |
| Making financial commitments | YES |
| Deleting data (files, DB rows, records) | YES |
| Merging to main branch | YES |
| Any action visible to external parties | YES |
| Internal work (writing files, creating tasks, research) | NO |

---

## Full Workflow

### 1. Create the approval

Use the native **Approvals** tool to create the approval request. Give it:

- **Title** — what you want to do (short, specific)
- **Category** — `external-comms` | `financial` | `deployment` | `data-deletion` | `other`
- **Context** — the draft content, the target/recipient, and why it's needed so the user can decide without asking follow-ups

Keep the approval ID it returns — you'll reference it when blocking your task and acting on the decision.

### 2. Block your task on the approval

Set your task to blocked so the work isn't lost while you wait:

- Use the **agent_bus** tool (action `update_task`) to move the task to `blocked` status, referencing the approval ID as the blocker and "awaiting approval" as the reason.
- Use the **agent_bus** tool (action `log_event`) to record a `task_blocked` event with the task ID, the blocking approval ID, and the reason — so the timeline reflects why the task stalled.

### 3. Notify the user

Approvals surface in the dashboard's Approvals view. Don't push a separate Telegram message — per Dartagnan's rule, approvals are dashboard-only, no Telegram approvals. Creating the approval in step 1 is the notification.

### 4. Wait for the decision

The user approves or rejects in the dashboard Approvals view. The resolution lands in your inbox — read it with the **agent_bus** tool (action `check_inbox`). It carries:

```
approval_id: appr_xxx
decision: approved | rejected
note: <user's note>
```

### 5. Act on the decision

**Approved:**

- Use the **agent_bus** tool (action `update_task`) to move the task back to `in_progress` with a note like "Approval received — executing".
- Execute the action.
- Use the **agent_bus** tool (action `complete_task`) to close the task with a result describing what was done.

**Rejected:**

- Use the **agent_bus** tool (action `complete_task`) to close the task with a result like "Cancelled — approval rejected: <note>".

## Re-pinging

If an approval is still pending after 4 hours during day mode, surface it once more — re-state it in your next status update or as a fresh note on the existing approval in the **Approvals** tool. Do NOT spam: one re-ping, then wait.

Note: this is a manual, in-session re-ping. If you need an automatic timed reminder (e.g. "ping me if still pending in 4h" when you won't be running), schedule it with the **cron** tool.

---

## Listing Pending Approvals

Read pending approvals with the **agent_bus** tool (action `list_approvals`), or open the Approvals view in the dashboard.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Create approval BEFORE starting the action** — never take the action first and ask forgiveness
2. **Always block your task** pointing to the approval ID — so work isn't lost while waiting
3. **Never assume approval** — if you don't have an inbox confirmation (agent_bus action `check_inbox`), you don't have approval
4. **One re-ping max** — after 4h, surface it once and wait
