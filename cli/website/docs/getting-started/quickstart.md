# Quickstart

This guide gets you from zero to a working Elevate setup that survives real use. Install, choose a provider, verify a working chat, and know exactly what to do when something breaks.

## Who this is for

- Brand new and want the shortest path to a working setup
- Switching providers and don't want to lose time to config mistakes
- Setting up Elevate for a team, bot, or always-on workflow
- Tired of "it installed, but it still does nothing"

## The fastest path

Pick the row that matches your goal:

| Goal | Do this first | Then do this |
|---|---|---|
| I just want Elevate working on my machine | `elevate setup` | Run a real chat and verify it responds |
| I already know my provider | `elevate model` | Save the config, then start chatting |
| I want a bot or always-on setup | `elevate gateway setup` after CLI works | Connect Telegram, Discord, Slack, or another platform |
| I want a local or self-hosted model | `elevate model` → custom endpoint | Verify the endpoint, model name, and context length |
| I want multi-provider fallback | `elevate model` first | Add routing and fallback only after the base chat works |

**Rule of thumb:** if Elevate cannot complete a normal chat, do not add more features yet. Get one clean conversation working first, then layer on gateway, cron, skills, voice, or routing.

## 1. Install Elevate

Run the one-line installer:

```bash
# Linux / macOS / WSL2 / Android (Termux)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CtrlStrategies/elevate/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

:::tip Android / Termux
If you're installing on a phone, see the dedicated [Termux guide](./termux.md) for the tested manual path, supported extras, and current Android-specific limitations.
:::

:::tip Windows Users
Install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first, then run the command above inside your WSL2 terminal.
:::

After it finishes, reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
```

For detailed installation options, prerequisites, and troubleshooting, see the [Installation guide](./installation.md).

## 2. Choose a Provider

The single most important setup step. Use `elevate model` to walk through the choice interactively:

```bash
elevate model
```

Good defaults:

| Situation | Recommended path |
|---|---|
| Least friction | Nous Portal or OpenRouter |
| You already have Claude or Codex auth | Anthropic or OpenAI Codex |
| You want local/private inference | Ollama or any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| You want multi-provider routing | OpenRouter |
| You have a custom GPU server | vLLM, SGLang, LiteLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

For most first-time users: choose a provider, accept the defaults unless you know why you're changing them. The full provider catalog with env vars and setup steps lives on the [Providers](../integrations/providers.md) page.

:::caution Minimum context: 64K tokens
Elevate requires a model with at least **64,000 tokens** of context. Models with smaller windows cannot maintain enough working memory for multi-step tool-calling workflows and will be rejected at startup. Most hosted models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek) meet this easily. If you're running a local model, set its context size to at least 64K (e.g. `--ctx-size 65536` for llama.cpp or `-c 65536` for Ollama).
:::

:::tip
You can switch providers at any time with `elevate model` — no lock-in. For a full list of all supported providers and setup details, see [AI Providers](../integrations/providers.md).
:::

### How settings are stored

Elevate separates secrets from normal config:

- **Secrets and tokens** → `~/.elevate/.env`
- **Non-secret settings** → `~/.elevate/config.yaml`

The easiest way to set values correctly is through the CLI:

```bash
elevate config set model anthropic/claude-opus-4.6
elevate config set terminal.backend docker
elevate config set OPENROUTER_API_KEY sk-or-...
```

The right value goes to the right file automatically.

## 3. Run Your First Chat

```bash
elevate            # classic CLI
elevate --tui      # modern TUI (recommended)
```

You'll see a welcome banner with your model, available tools, and skills. Use a prompt that's specific and easy to verify:

:::tip Pick your interface
Elevate ships with two terminal interfaces: the classic `prompt_toolkit` CLI and a newer [TUI](../user-guide/tui.md) with modal overlays, mouse selection, and non-blocking input. Both share the same sessions, slash commands, and config — try each with `elevate` vs `elevate --tui`.
:::

```
Summarize this repo in 5 bullets and tell me what the main entrypoint is.
```

```
Check my current directory and tell me what looks like the main project file.
```

```
Help me set up a clean GitHub PR workflow for this codebase.
```

**What success looks like:**

- The banner shows your chosen model/provider
- Elevate replies without error
- It can use a tool if needed (terminal, file read, web search)
- The conversation continues normally for more than one turn

If that works, you're past the hardest part.

## 4. Verify Sessions Work

Before moving on, make sure resume works:

```bash
elevate --continue    # Resume the most recent session
elevate -c            # Short form
```

That should bring you back to the session you just had. If it doesn't, check whether you're in the same profile and whether the session actually saved. This matters later when you're juggling multiple setups or machines.

## 5. Try Key Features

### Use the terminal

```
❯ What's my disk usage? Show the top 5 largest directories.
```

The agent runs terminal commands on your behalf and shows results.

### Slash commands

Type `/` to see an autocomplete dropdown of all commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/tools` | List available tools |
| `/model` | Switch models interactively |
| `/personality pirate` | Try a fun personality |
| `/save` | Save the conversation |

### Multi-line input

Press `Alt+Enter` or `Ctrl+J` to add a new line. Great for pasting code or writing detailed prompts.

### Interrupt the agent

If the agent is taking too long, type a new message and press Enter — it interrupts the current task and switches to your new instructions. `Ctrl+C` also works.

## 6. Add the Next Layer

Only after the base chat works. Pick what you need:

### Bot or shared assistant

```bash
elevate gateway setup    # Interactive platform configuration
```

Connect [Telegram](/docs/user-guide/messaging/telegram), [Discord](/docs/user-guide/messaging/discord), [Slack](/docs/user-guide/messaging/slack), [WhatsApp](/docs/user-guide/messaging/whatsapp), [Signal](/docs/user-guide/messaging/signal), [Email](/docs/user-guide/messaging/email), or [Home Assistant](/docs/user-guide/messaging/homeassistant).

### Automation and tools

- `elevate tools` — tune tool access per platform
- `elevate skills` — browse and install reusable workflows
- Cron — only after your bot or CLI setup is stable

### Sandboxed terminal

For safety, run the agent in a Docker container or on a remote server:

```bash
elevate config set terminal.backend docker    # Docker isolation
elevate config set terminal.backend ssh       # Remote server
```

### Voice mode

```bash
pip install "elevate[voice]"
# Includes faster-whisper for free local speech-to-text
```

Then in the CLI: `/voice on`. Press `Ctrl+B` to record. See [Voice Mode](../user-guide/features/voice-mode.md).

### Skills

```bash
elevate skills search kubernetes
elevate skills install openai/skills/k8s
```

Or use `/skills` inside a chat session.

### MCP servers

```yaml
# Add to ~/.elevate/config.yaml
mcp_servers:
  github:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: "ghp_xxx"
```

### Editor integration (ACP)

```bash
pip install -e '.[acp]'
elevate acp
```

See [ACP Editor Integration](../user-guide/features/acp.md).

## Common Failure Modes

These are the problems that waste the most time:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Elevate opens but gives empty or broken replies | Provider auth or model selection is wrong | Run `elevate model` again and confirm provider, model, and auth |
| Custom endpoint "works" but returns garbage | Wrong base URL, model name, or not actually OpenAI-compatible | Verify the endpoint in a separate client first |
| Gateway starts but nobody can message it | Bot token, allowlist, or platform setup is incomplete | Re-run `elevate gateway setup` and check `elevate gateway status` |
| `elevate --continue` can't find old session | Switched profiles or session never saved | Check `elevate sessions list` and confirm you're in the right profile |
| Model unavailable or odd fallback behavior | Provider routing or fallback settings are too aggressive | Keep routing off until the base provider is stable |
| `elevate doctor` flags config problems | Config values are missing or stale | Fix the config, retest a plain chat before adding features |

## Recovery Toolkit

When something feels off, use this order:

1. `elevate doctor`
2. `elevate model`
3. `elevate setup`
4. `elevate sessions list`
5. `elevate --continue`
6. `elevate gateway status`

That sequence gets you from "broken vibes" back to a known state fast.
