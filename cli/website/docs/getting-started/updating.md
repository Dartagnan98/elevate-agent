# Updating & Uninstalling

## Updating

Update to the latest version with a single command:

```bash
elevate update
```

This pulls the latest code, updates dependencies, and prompts you to configure any new options that were added since your last update.

:::tip
`elevate update` automatically detects new configuration options and prompts you to add them. If you skipped that prompt, you can manually run `elevate config check` to see missing options, then `elevate config migrate` to interactively add them.
:::

### What happens during an update

When you run `elevate update`, the following steps occur:

1. **Git pull** — pulls the latest code from the `main` branch and updates submodules
2. **Dependency install** — runs `uv pip install -e ".[all]"` to pick up new or changed dependencies
3. **Config migration** — detects new config options added since your version and prompts you to set them
4. **Gateway auto-restart** — if the gateway service is running (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS), it is **automatically restarted** after the update completes so the new code takes effect immediately

Expected output looks like:

```
$ elevate update
Updating Elevate...
📥 Pulling latest code...
Already up to date.  (or: Updating abc1234..def5678)
📦 Updating dependencies...
✅ Dependencies updated
🔍 Checking for new config options...
✅ Config is up to date  (or: Found 2 new options — running migration...)
🔄 Restarting gateway service...
✅ Gateway restarted
✅ Elevate updated successfully!
```

### Recommended Post-Update Validation

`elevate update` handles the main update path, but a quick validation confirms everything landed cleanly:

1. `git status --short` — if the tree is unexpectedly dirty, inspect before continuing
2. `elevate doctor` — checks config, dependencies, and service health
3. `elevate --version` — confirm the version bumped as expected
4. If you use the gateway: `elevate gateway status`
5. If `doctor` reports npm audit issues: run `npm audit fix` in the flagged directory

:::warning Dirty working tree after update
If `git status --short` shows unexpected changes after `elevate update`, stop and inspect them before continuing. This usually means local modifications were reapplied on top of the updated code, or a dependency step refreshed lockfiles.
:::

### If your terminal disconnects mid-update

`elevate update` protects itself against accidental terminal loss:

- The update ignores `SIGHUP`, so closing your SSH session or terminal window no longer kills it mid-install. `pip` and `git` child processes inherit this protection, so the Python environment cannot be left half-installed by a dropped connection.
- All output is mirrored to `~/.elevate/logs/update.log` while the update runs. If your terminal disappears, reconnect and inspect the log to see whether the update finished and whether the gateway restart succeeded:

```bash
tail -f ~/.elevate/logs/update.log
```

- `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) and system shutdown (SIGTERM) are still honored — those are deliberate cancellations, not accidents.

You no longer need to wrap `elevate update` in `screen` or `tmux` to survive a terminal drop.

### Checking your current version

```bash
elevate version
```

Compare against the latest release at the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Dartagnan98/elevate-agent/releases).

### Updating from Messaging Platforms

You can also update directly from Telegram, Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp by sending:

```
/update
```

This pulls the latest code, updates dependencies, and restarts the gateway. The bot will briefly go offline during the restart (typically 5–15 seconds) and then resume.

### Manual Update

If you installed manually (not via the quick installer):

```bash
cd /path/to/elevate
export VIRTUAL_ENV="$(pwd)/venv"

# Pull latest code and submodules
git pull origin main
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Reinstall (picks up new dependencies)
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
uv pip install -e "./tinker-atropos"

# Check for new config options
elevate config check
elevate config migrate   # Interactively add any missing options
```

### Rollback instructions

If an update introduces a problem, you can roll back to a previous version:

```bash
cd /path/to/elevate

# List recent versions
git log --oneline -10

# Roll back to a specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# Restart the gateway if running
elevate gateway restart
```

To roll back to a specific release tag:

```bash
git checkout v0.6.0
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

:::warning
Rolling back may cause config incompatibilities if new options were added. Run `elevate config check` after rolling back and remove any unrecognized options from `config.yaml` if you encounter errors.
:::

### Note for Nix users

If you installed via Nix flake, updates are managed through the Nix package manager:

```bash
# Update the flake input
nix flake update elevate

# Or rebuild with the latest
nix profile upgrade elevate
```

Nix installations are immutable — rollback is handled by Nix's generation system:

```bash
nix profile rollback
```

See [Nix Setup](./nix-setup.md) for more details.

## Uninstalling

```bash
elevate uninstall
```

The uninstaller gives you the option to keep your configuration files (`~/.elevate/`) for a future reinstall.

### Manual Uninstall

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/elevate
rm -rf /path/to/elevate
rm -rf ~/.elevate            # Optional — keep if you plan to reinstall
```

:::info
If you installed the gateway as a system service, stop and disable it first:
```bash
elevate gateway stop
# Linux: systemctl --user disable elevate-gateway
# macOS: launchctl remove ai.elevate.gateway
```
